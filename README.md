 
# Flask App with MySQL Docker Setup

This is a simple Flask app that interacts with a MySQL database. The app allows users to submit messages, which are then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.



To stop and remove the Docker containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the containers are running, or use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## To run this two-tier application using  without docker-compose

- First create a docker image from Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t flaskapp .
```

- Now, make sure that you have created a network using following command
```bash
docker network create twotier
```

- Attach both the containers in the same network, so that they can communicate with each other

i) MySQL container 
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name mysql \
    -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
    --network=twotier \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    mysql:5.7

```
ii) Backend container
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name flaskapp \
    --network=twotier \
    -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql \
    -e MYSQL_USER=root \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin \
    -e MYSQL_DB=mydb \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    flaskapp:latest

```

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholders (e.g., `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`) with your actual MySQL configuration.

- This is a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should follow best practices for security and performance.

- Be cautious when executing SQL queries directly. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

- If you encounter issues, check Docker logs and error messages for troubleshooting.
